# About

Hey guys, Juan here from [juanmtech.com](https://www.juanmtech.com). These are the Home Assistant configuration files I use in my personal Home Assistant set up. Hopefully, this repository can help you get started with Home Assistant and give you some ideas for your own configuration.

If you are new to Home Assistant, I recommend visiting my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/JuanMTech) and [website](https://www.juanmtech.com) where you can find easy to follow tutorials on how to get started.<br />
