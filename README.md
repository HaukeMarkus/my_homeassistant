## My HA configuration

My home configuration 

I use my homeassistant to control my home. To move rollershutters after sunrise and sunset I use shellies 2.5.
To control my irrigation I created a solution based on the SONOFF 4chpro switch from tasmota which controls 4 irrigation zones / valves.

Those are Hunter valves connected to a tube system from Gardena.


Technically I am actually using a lot of shellies:
- Shelly 1: as light switches, garage door opener
- Shelly HT: as temperature sensor
- Shelly 2.5: as rollershutter driver for my basement windows

Fritz.

Furthermore I have a 
- Fritzbox Switch, 
- a SONOFF 4chPro switch Tasmota via MQTT [SONOFF](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/devices/Sonoff-4CH-Pro/)
